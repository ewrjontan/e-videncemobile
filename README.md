# E-Vidence

## Description

This is my first React-Native application created for my Nucamp class. It is a mobile application for streamlined evidence collection and tracking. 

Working as a crime scene investigator, I am not thrilled with our current software/database. My colleagues and I constantly wish for different things, or discuss how it would
be nice if we could do this and that. So I decided to build an application that I could cater to our exact needs. The application is meant to provide simplified and efficient evidence booking while in the field; saving investigators from having to enter everything upon returning to their "office." Perhaps I can convince my department to use it someday. 

## Usage

The application currently allows for the following in conjunction with my mongoDB server:
- User registration, login/logout and authentication
- Obtaining list of users as well as user information
- Adding, viewing and editing incidents or cases
- Adding, viewing and editing case information or evidence items

Currently, the application is being developed with an Android simulator (Pixel 4). Optimization for iOS will be coming. 

## Roadmap

Future updates include:
* Fully integrating it with my back-end application; I still have a few endpoints to tie together.
* I plan to add camera functionality; being able to add quick photographs of evidence items in the field would be a nice feature, especially when weather or other factors might
prevent us from documenting evidence with our DSLR cameras
* Full integration with the desktop/web version once I finish building it.
* I hope to optimize it for iOS when I finish it up for Android
